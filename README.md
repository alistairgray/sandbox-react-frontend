## Its Purpose
Because I am still in the early phase of my development career, I thought I would create an app that both demonstrates my abilities with different languages and methodologies, whilst also encouraging me to build, experiment and learn through the process. I'm keeping this one public as it serves as another motivator to code.

## Sprint - 26/03/21 - 09/03/21
- Create a React AJAX frontend
- Integrate two external APIs into a Node Express backend and print them on the frontend
- Create a pure css environment and not rely on Bootstrap
- Integrate an IBM Watson chatbot
